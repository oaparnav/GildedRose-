Gilded Rose kata
================

Your manager approached the team one day:

"Team, I just learnt that our organization runs a little shop called Gilded Rose where we
sell some different types of items. There is a little bit of code that they wrote to keep
track of the inventory in the shop. Apparently this was written many years ago and the
developer who wrote it is no longer working here. They reached out to me and asked if we
could add a small feature. I said yes. Can you guys do it?"

"All I know is that the shop can have some items in inventory and every day the quality of
the items changes. There are different types of items which behave differently for which
no one remembers the business rules. This is all I know"

"Here is the requirement that I received:"

"Add support for a `mask of sunshine` item which degrades at twice the rate as a normal item"

"Team, we need this update by the end of the week."

"Good luck"
